/**
 * The core package contains all needed interfaces by the other modules of the language extension library.

 *     The base interface for all classes in the library is the {@link com.jongsoft.lang.Value} interface.
 *     This interface dictates a certain interaction that promotes functional behaviour of classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     There is also an interface {@link com.jongsoft.lang.Presence} which lays the foundation for a purely
 *     functional implementation of the Java 8 {@link java.util.Optional}.
